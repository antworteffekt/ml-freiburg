* variable coding and its effects on topology (always 10 inputs, 3 outputs, variable
no. of hidden nodes)

* independent variables: regularisation, training function, network top.

* attempted with neurolab, failed, ended up using matlab

* picture of matlab interface

* graph of independent variables for each factor level of age (the different
means of the variables for each level of the factor variable, etc)
** principal component analysis

----------
* what has an effect on test error: regularisation, training function, network topology, and what has no effect
* information on bayesian regularisation

* same for training error
* conclude that class 2 is the most difficult to classify correctly =>
* confusion matrices
